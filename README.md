# pyCapsid

## Description
pyCapsid is a Python package that identifies dominant motions, rigid domains, and disassembly units of protein shells (and other macromolecular complexes), combining elastic network models and clustering methods. The input of pyCapsid is a molecular structure from the Protein Data Bank (PDBid) or in PDB format. The output of pyCapsid includes a report that includes key analyses and figures.
