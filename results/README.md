## Folders
+ `performance`: This folder contains the files associated with the performance analysis of pyCapsid.
+ `disassembly`: This folder contains the files associated with the disassembly results of pyCapsid.

## Files
+ `pyCapsid_hk97_data_cbrown_thesis.csv`: .csv file containing data from an application of pyCapsid to 25 protein shells using the hk97 fold, which was included in the [Master's Thesis "Structural Analysis of HK97-Fold Protein Shells Using Quasi-Rigid Domain Decomposition"](https://www.proquest.com/openview/4677c1bd67879cbdd37a91ffab8de913/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y) by Colin Brown in the Physics program at San Diego State University. This thesis was foundational for the initial development of pyCapsid.
