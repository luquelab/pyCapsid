# Predictions of disassembly units in protein shells

## Introduction
The combination of elastic network models (ENM), normal mode analysis (NMA), and vibrational cluster decomposition identify quasi-rigid mechanical units in protein shells (or other macromolecular complexes) (REFS). In prior studies, the emphasis have been put in interpreting these mechanical units as the assembly subunits (REFS). However, viral capsids are often subject to maturation processes that alter the capsid mechanically, including protein cleavage, protein allostery, and the addition of reinforcement proteins. Therefore, the quasi-rigid units identified by pyCapsid and analogous approaches can be interpreted as the mechanical units that are likely to be involved in the initial steps of the disassembly of a capsid (or a macromolecular complex). To test the use of pyCapsid to the identification of disassembly units, we investigated seven viral capsids that had been reported to disassembly in vitro by different methods.

## Methods

**Viral capsid selection.** Research articles reporting controlled disassembly experiments of viral capsids were searched through Google Scholar and through recent reviews in capsid assembly and disassembly (REFS). The initial pool was filtered based on capsids that had available molecular models deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (link). The final list included seven capsids, which were organized in two groups: Group 1 included capsids that disassemble as part of the virus life cycle; Group 2 included capsids that do not disassemble during the virus life cycle. In the second group, the capsids were divided in two subgroups depending on if the capsids that were observed to completely (Group 2.1) or partially (Group 2.2) disassemble *in vitro*. Viral capsid name, PDB ID, virus taxonomy (realm, order, family), virus host, virus relevance, method for disassembly *in vitro*, disassembly units observed, references, and disassembly group for each capsid are listed below:

+ **Seneca Valley virus (SSV) capsid:** PDBID [3cji](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb3CJI/pdb) ([Venkatamaran *et al.* 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2008.07.013)). *Riboviria* *Picornavirales* *Picornaviridae*. Porcine virus that has been repurposed as an oncolytic agent because it can infect human cancer cells. Disassembly was observed for the virion and procapsid in pH stability experiments in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) ([Strauss *et al.* 2018](https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01927-17)). Acidic conditions promoted the disassembly; the virion disassembled at pH ≤ 5.5 and procapsids at pH ≤ 6.0. The experiments identified 5-fold symmetric clusters each containing 15 major capsid proteins as the dissociation units. The major capsid proteins displayed the characteristic jelly roll fold (with 8 beta-strands arranged in a barrel-like structure). The authors named them the disassembly units as pentamers because the major capsid proteins exist as three variants (VP1, VP2, and VP3), and there are five of each in the so called pentamer. However, here we will refer to them as pentons, because pentamer is tipically used for clusters with five proteins. In the life cycle, it has been observed that a minor capsid protein, VP4, is removed, providing a pore where the genome is translocated, so the capsid does not necessarily fully disassemble as part of the life cycle. Disassembly Group 2.1. DONE.

+ **Triatoma virus (TrV) capsid:** PDBID [3nap](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb3NAP/pdb) ([Squires *et al.* 2013](https://doi.org/10.1107%2FS0907444913004617)). *Riboviria* *Picornavirales* *Dicistroviridae*. Virus infecting (triatomine) insects (kissing bugs), which are vectors of human trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease). Thus, TrV is a potential biological agent of interest to reduce Chagas disease. The capsid structure was resolved at 2.5 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography. The capsid contains three variants of the major capsid protein (VP1, VP2, and VP3) and a minor protein (VP4). The major capsid proteins adopt the jelly roll fold ([Squires *et al.* 2013](https://doi.org/10.1107%2FS0907444913004617)). The virus does not rely on capsid disassembly to infect the host. But capsid disassembly was observed in viruses stored X. Cryo-electron dissociation units were visualized by cryo-EM, revealing 5-fold symmetrical pentons (15 MCPs). The pentons were observed to form a penton-penton lip-shaped particles (LPs). The disassembly of capsids was observed as an spontaneous process when storing TrV virions after 1 week at 4°C ([Agirre *et al.* 2013](https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.048553-0)). Disassembly Group 2.1. DONE.

+ HERE!!! **Hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid:** PDBID [2g33](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb2G33/pdb) ([REF](https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00933-06)). *Riboviria* *Blubervirales* *Hepadnaviridae*. The *in vitro* disassembly method was METHOD??? (Spectroscopy???). Both spectroscopy experiments and molecular dynamics simulations have been applied to explore the disassembly of this capsid, and both identify the dimers as the disassembly unit. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.1c00810) (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2102530118). Disassembly Group 1. 

+ **Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) capsid:** PDBID [1za7](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb1ZA7/pdb) ([REF](https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.80.7.3582-3591.2006)). Experimental results suggest that the capsid disassembles into dimeric groups. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2007.07.020). CCMV also undergoes a swelling transition before disassembly (https://doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(01)00135-6). Disassembly Group 1.

+ **Bacteriophage MS2 capsid:** PDBID [2ms2](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb2MS2/pdb) ([REF](https://doi.org/10.1006/jmbi.1993.1616)). *Riboviria* *Norzivirales* *Fiersviridae*. Virus infecting *E. coli*. The disassembly method is METHOD??? (NMR??). The capsid dissociates into dimers. (https://doi.org/10.1016%2FS0006-3495(03)75117-0). Disassembly Group 2.1. 

+ **Bacteriophage P22 mature capsid:** PDBID [5uu5](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb5UU5/pdb) ([REF](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1621152114)). The *in vitro* disassembly method was METHOD???. Heating the expanded shell of P22 has been shown to cause the pentamers to release, resulting in a “wiffle ball” structure. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2018.03.006). Disassembly Group 2.2.

+ **Bacteriophage HK97 mature capsid:** PDBID [2ft1](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb2FT1/pdb) ([REF](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2006.09.006)). The *in vitro* disassembly method was METHOD???. HK97 has also been observed to form the “wiffle ball” structures as in P22. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2005.02.045). Disassembly Group 2.2.

**Identification of disassembly units.** The pyCapsid packaged was applied to analyze the viral capsids and identify quasi-rigid regions in the capsids, which were interpreted as potential disassembly units. The unified elastic network model (U-ENM), known also as the generalized anisotropic network model (G-ANM), was applied to all capsids and calibrated with the experimental B-factors. The default number of modes (200) was increased systematically to guarantee predicted B-factors mimicking the overall empirical B-factors measured across amino-acid residues and reaching a correlation coefficient above 0.5. This led to a range of normal modes from X to Y and B-factors correlations from X to Y. The default clustering method (SAY WHICH ONE) was across a number of clusters that ranged from X to Y. The standard quasi-rigid cluster coefficient score defined in X was used to identify quasi-rigid mechanical units (peaks) as a function of the number of clusters. If more that one peak (local maximum) was observed, they were ranked by score value (descending order). The quasi-rigid domains were visualized using the pyCapsid module to generate results to be displayed in ChimeraX, and the standard pyCapsid output report was generated. The identified quasi-rigid mechanical units were compared with the protein complexes observed in disassembly experiments. For those capsids were the disassembly was partial, the predictions from pyCapsid were filtered as a function of the intensity of B-factors (quasi-rigid units associated with larger B-factors were interpreted as more prone to disassembly first).

## Results and Discussion

+ **Seneca Valley virus (SVV) capsid:** PDBID [3cji](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb3CJI/pdb). In the pyCapsid analysis, the number of modes were increased to 800, reaching a correlation coefficient of CC = 0.64 between empirical and experimental and predicted B-factors. The predicted B-factor profile displayed larger fluctuations in a few small regions of about ~15 amino-acids, probably due to the presence of RNA in the capsids, which was not included in the PDB or in pyCapsid's model (!!! COLIN: Is the largest signal associated with the residues of VP4 (the minor capsid protein)???)). The clustering analysis revealed a prominent peak associated with the presence of 12 clusters of a unique type. The visual analysis identified these clusters as pentons containing each 15 MCPs (five copies of each of the three variants, VP1, VP2, and VP3). These pentons coincide with dissociation units observed in the disassembly experiments of the capsid [Strauss *et al.* 2018](https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01927-17). To access the figures associated with the results summarized above, we refer the reader to the online [SSV's pyCapsid report](https://luquelab.github.io/pyCapsid/gallery/3cji_pyCapsid_report/pyCapsid_report.html). DONE (with small caveat the requires attention).

+ **Triatoma virus capsid:** PDBID [3nap](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb3NAP/pdb). In the pyCapsid analysis, the number of modes were increased to 1200, reaching a correlation coefficient of CC = 0.42 between empirical and experimental and predicted B-factors. The predicted B-factor recovered the overall pattern across residues, but was short in capturing relatively large fluctuations in two regions of about 20 residues around the regions 0 and 250. The maximum cluster quality score was observed as a sharp peak at 12 clusters of a unique type. The visual analysis identified these clusters as pentons containing each 15 MCPs (five copies of each of the three variants, VP1, VP2, and VP3). These pentons coincided with the dissociation units observed in the disassembly experiments of the capsid [Agirre *et al.* 2013](https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.048553-0)). To access the figures associated with the results summarized above, we refer the reader to the online [TrV's pyCapsid report](https://luquelab.github.io/pyCapsid/gallery/3nap_pyCapsid_report/pyCapsid_report.html). DONE.

+ **Hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid:** PDBID [2g33](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb2G33/pdb). pyCapsid’s b-factor predictions have a correlation coefficient of 0.57 with the experimental b-factors at 800 modes. pyCapsid identifies the rigid clusters as 120 dimers, each containing 2 MCPs. Both spectroscopy experiments and molecular dynamics simulations have been applied to explore the disassembly of this capsid, and both identify the dimers as the disassembly unit matching our prediction. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.1c00810) (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2102530118) 

+ **Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) capsid:** PDBID [1za7](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb1ZA7/pdb). pyCapsid’s b-factor predictions have a correlation coefficient of 0.56 with the experimental b-factors at 6000 modes. pyCapsid identifies the rigid clusters as the 180 MCPs, one MCP per cluster. Experimental results do not support this and suggest that the capsid disassembles into dimeric groups. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2007.07.020) This capsid requires a large number of modes to yield accurate correlations, with a CC of only 0.08 at 800 modes. This suggests that there may be something unique about the dynamics of the capsid that may make it more difficult for ENM/NMA methods describe. CCMV also undergoes a swelling transition before disassembly, and this intermediate swollen state may have different rigid subunits than the native state, possibly explaning pyCapsid's incorrect disassembly prediction. (https://doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(01)00135-6)

+ **Bacteriophage MS2 capsid:** PDBID [2ms2](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb2MS2/pdb). pyCapsid’s b-factor predictions have a correlation coefficient of 0.66 with the experimental b-factors at 800 modes. pyCapsid identifies the rigid clusters as 90 dimers, each containing 2 MCPs. This matches observations from NMR experiments that the capsid dissociates into dimers. (https://doi.org/10.1016%2FS0006-3495(03)75117-0) 

+ **Bacteriophage P22 mature capsid:** PDBID [5uu5](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb5UU5/pdb). pyCapsid’s b-factor predictions have a correlation coefficient of 0.6 with the experimental b-factors at 3800 modes. pyCapsid identifies the rigid clusters as either 12 pentons containing 35 MCPs each or as 12 pentamers containing 5 MCPs each and 60 hexamers containing 6 MCPs each. These correspond to the peaks in the quality score at 12 and 72. Heating the expanded shell of P22 has been shown to cause the pentamers to release, resulting in a “wiffle ball” structure. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2018.03.006) This is consistent with the prediction at 72 clusters which includes pentamers as a rigid subunit.

+ **Bacteriophage HK97 mature capsid:** PDBID [2ft1](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb2FT1/pdb). pyCapsid’s b-factor predictions have a correlation coefficient of 0.55 with the experimental b-factors at 10000 modes. pyCapsid identifies the rigid clusters as primarily the core residues of the 420 MCPs and 64 clusters corresponding to small extended domains of less than 10 residues for a total of 484 clusters. HK97 has also been observed to form the “wiffle ball” structures as in P22. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2005.02.045) pyCapsid didn’t successfully predict pentameric disassembly units in this case, unlike in P22, but the prediction of individual MCPs isn’t inconsistent with pentamers.

## Conclusions
pyCapsid predicted correctly X out of Y capsids analyzed. Among the Z where the predictions were din not exactly match the subunits found dissociated in disassembly experiments, pyCapsid identified solutions that were not incompatible. Besides, this cases displayed also different disassembly situations... CCMV, for example, ... Then HK97-fold... Given that disassembly experiments rely on stressful conditions, pyCapsid provides a guide on how new approaches could be developed targeting the predicted mechanical units. On the other side, it will be necessary to couple the force-fields of pyCapsid to adapt to the disassembly conditions.
