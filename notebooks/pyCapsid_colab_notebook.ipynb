        "This Colab notebook contains a pipeline to predict dominant dynamics and quasi-rigid mechanical units in large protein complexes. The outputs capture the molecular regions likely to be involved in structural transitions, including transitions triggering the disassembly of the protein complex.\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook builds on the Python package [pyCapsid](https://luquelab.github.io/pyCapsid/), which combines elastic network models, normal mode analysis, and clustering methods. The current version is targeted towards protein shells, like viral capsids. Check pyCapsid's [online documentation](https://luquelab.github.io/pyCapsid/) for further technical details."

        "If you are a first time user, we recommend you to test that your browser works well with the Colab notebook and that it can download the outputs expected by the default values. Click the `Runtime` menu on the navigation bar and select `Run all`. Read steps `4.` and `5.` from the list below to navigate and interpret the outputs. If your browser does not produce any outputs, test the the notebook on [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). If you encounter any problems when adapting the notebook to your specific structure, [open an issue in the pyCapsid repository](https://github.com/luquelab/pyCapsid/issues), and we will respond as soon as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the test suggested above worked well in your browser, follow the steps described below to obtain the dominant dynamics and quasi-rigid units of the protein complex of your interest. To navigate this notebook, we recommend displaying the Colab notebook's Table of contents (open the `View` menu on the top bar and choose `Table of contents`):\n",
        "1. Specify the structure to be analyzed in the [Input structure](#scrollTo=Input_structure) section. Run the code block to set the parameters and, if not fetching a remote structure, upload the structure file.\n",
        "2. Modify the default pyCapsid parameters if necessary in the [pyCapsid parameters](#scrollTo=pyCapsid_parameters) section. Run the code block to set the parameters.\n",
        "3. Execute the rest of the notebook by navigating the Colab menu `Runtime` and choosing the option `Run all` or `Run after` in the cell after the pyCapsid parameters. This will install pyCapsid, run the pipeline, and generate and download the results.\n",
        "  + The pipeline will automatically compress and download the outputs in two zip files. Your browser might prompt a request to allow the downloading process. `pyCapsid_report.zip` contains key results, a report summarizing them, and instructions for visualizing the results in ChimeraX. `pyCapsid_results.zip` contains all of the relevant data files created by pyCapsid and a readme describing their contents.  \n",
        "  + If you encounter any issues in the downloading process, check the section [Problems downloading results?](#scrollTo=Problems_downloading_results_)\n",
        "  + The execution time and maximum size of the protein complex depend on the computing power and memory of the Colab cloud service used, which depends on the user's Colab plan. The section [Estimate time and memory](#scrollTo=Estimate_time_and_memory) gives an estimate of the time and memory requirements based on the number of residues in the structure.\n",
        "4. Extract and read the downloaded report (`pyCapsid_report.*`) for a summary and interpretation of the main results. The report is available in three formats: Markdown, (`*.md`), Microsoft Word (`*.docx`), and Web page's HyperText Markup Language (`*.html`). The multi-formatted report aims to facilitate users adapting pyCapsid's results to their publication needs. Check the section [pyCapsid report](#scrollTo=pyCapsid_report) for further details.   \n",
        "   + Additional results (mostly print outputs) are displayed throughout the notebook cells in the [Run the pyCapsid pipeline](#scrollTo=Run_the_pyCapsid_pipeline) section. For further technical details look at the output of cells in this section of the notebook.\n",
        "5. The 3D images of the protein complex will be missing in `pyCapsid_report.*`. You will need to generate them using [ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/). This will also generate interactive models that you may use to make custom visualizations.\n",
        "  + We recommend downloading and installing ChimeraX from [here](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/download.html).\n",
        "  + To visualize the quasi-rigid domains obtained, open a new session in ChimeraX and run the following instruction in the command line to open a file browser in ChimeraX:\n",
        "```\n",
        "runscript browse\n",
        "```\n",
        "  + Then, inside the browser, navigate in the `pyCapsid_report/chimerax/` folder and open the script `chimerax_script_colab.py`.\n",
        "  + This will generate a 3D model of the protein complex coloring the quasi-rigid domains in ChimeraX and store snapshots in the folder `pyCapsid_report/figures/structures/` that will be visible in the `.html` and `.md` reports.\n",
        "  + To generate an animation of the dynamics of the lowest-frequency non-degenerate mode, start a new ChimeraX session and follow the same steps above, but opening instead the script `chimerax_script_animate_mode.py`.\n",
        "  + This will generate a movie in `mp4` format in the same folder as the images mentioned above.\n",
        "  + Only one mode may be visualized at a time. By default the lowest frequency non-degenerate mode is visualized, and only modes of that frequency and lower are included in the report. To visualize higher frequency modes, you may copy the `modes.npz` file from `pyCapsid_results.zip` to the `chimerax` folder of the report and rename it accordingly.\n",
        "  + The optional arguments of these scripts are described in the [ChimeraX visualization options](#scrollTo=ChimeraX_visualization_options) section.\n",
        "  + Both scripts can be modified to fit the users needs. To do this reference the ChimeraX commands (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/docs/user/index.html) and the ChimeraX Python API (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/docs/devel/index.html#).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Optionally, read the section [Generate advanced analysis](#scrollTo=Generate_advanced_analysis) to learn how to obtain advanced analyses using results stored during the execution of the pyCapsid pipeline.\n"
