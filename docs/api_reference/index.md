# API Reference

Document the various modules and functions in the package.

## PDB Utility
Module with functions for downloading and dealing with PDB/PDBx files.

## Elastic Network Models
Module with functions for building hessian matrices of different elastic network models.

## Normal Mode Analysis (Eigen)
Module with functions for calculating the normal modes and frequencies of a given hessian. Eigenvalue/vector functions.

## Mechanical Analysis
Module with functions for calculating mechanical properties from NMA results. I.e. squared fluctuations, distance 
fluctuations, compressibility, collectivity etc.

## Quasi-rigid Domain Decomposition
Module with functions for identifying quasi-rigid clusters given a distance fluctuation matrix, either calculated using 
ENM or provided.

## Visualization: ChimeraX Bundle
Need to figure out best way to do visualization.
