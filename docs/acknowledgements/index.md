## Special mention
The pyCapsid team would like to thank the insights from the San Diego State University Biomath Group, particularly professors Arlette Baljon and Parag Katira. Finally, this project would not have been possible without the hard work of [Colin Brown](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-travis-brown/) in his outstanding [Master's Thesis project](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2774448003?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true) investigating the quasi-rigid domain decomposition of HK97-fold capsids.
