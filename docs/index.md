# pyCapsid Documentation


pyCapsid is an accessible high performance python package used to identify the motions and quasi-rigid regions of large protein complexes and 
generate comprehensive outputs to interpret the results. The development of pyCapsid is a result of our lab's need for
high performance computational tools when investigating macromolecular protein shells. Such protein shells include viral capsids, cellular 
protein compartments like encapsulins, and capsids of gene transfer agents (GTAs), gene vectors or antivirals.

pyCapsid uses coarse-grained elastic network models in conjunction with normal mode analysis to model the motions of large 
protein complexes. These methods are commonly available in existing packages such as [ProDy](http://prody.csb.pitt.edu/)
but pyCapsid is significantly more optimized for analyzing large protein complexes. pyCapsid can perform NMA in as low as
1/5th the time for even small protein shells.
